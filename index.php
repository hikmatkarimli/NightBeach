            <h3>Template Notes</h3>
            <p>The main image can be changed by either replacing the current image with another one of the same size
                (900x402), or using a new one of whatever dimensions you'd like. If you choose the latter, you must open
                up style.css and change the dimensions of #mainpic, as well as the file name if that is different. If
                you would like to move the heading around in the above image, find "#mainpic h1" in style.css and modify
                its "left" and "top" properties; this is also true for the h2 tag.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>More information</h3>
            <p>I decided to leave the content portion open for the template users to do as they wish with a blank
                canvas. I don't like to restrict my users too much, and for this reason, I leave the defining of any
                content-related styles to you.</p>
